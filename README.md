# 2ki – ~2^11 programs in 10 years

[Wikipedia says of van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh):

> In just over a decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, including 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints.

If distributed uniformly that's about 210 works a year or about 4 a week every week for 10 years.

Inspiring.

How many programs would I write in a 10 year period?

Some of these come from other programs or some go into other programs in other repositories later. Program sketches are encouraged.
